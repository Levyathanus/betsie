# B√©tsie üé®
A simple image editor based on B√©zier splines and affine transformations.

This has been made as the final exam project for the [Geometria Computazionale](http://www.mat.unimi.it/users/alzati/Geometria_Computazionale_98-99/) 
CS master degree course by prof. Alberto Alzati (A.Y. 2022/2023).

## Dev Notes üìù

You can use `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies. I personally use `npm` because it's what I use on most of my projects:

`npm install` - Installs dependencies. You can use any of those.

`npm run dev` - Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`

`npm run build` - Build your production site to `./dist/`

`npm run preview` - Preview your build locally, before deploying

`npm run build:preview` - Build your production site to `./dist/` and preview it locally
